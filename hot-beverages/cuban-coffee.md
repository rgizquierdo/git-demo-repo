# Cuban Coffee

## Description: Standard Cuban coffee

## Ingredients

- Espresso ground coffee (preferably a dark roast or Cuban coffee blend)
- White sugar
- Water
- Espresso maker or moka pot

## How to Make Cuban coffee

### Step 1

- Start with cold water and coffee grounds in the espresso maker or moka pot. Use about 1-2 tbsp of ground coffee per 1-2 oz of water.

### Step 2

- Brew the coffee to make a strong, concentrated shot of espresso coffee.

### Step 3

- In a separate cup or serving glass, add 1-2 tsp of white sugar per 1-2 oz of brewed espresso. The sugar helps cut the bitterness.

### Step 4

- Once the coffee is brewed, pour a small amount first into the sugar to help it dissolve and create the base espumita foam.

### Step 5

- Add the remaining brewed coffee while continuing to gently whisk or stir to create a thick, sweet crema foam on top.

### Step 6

- Optionally, you can add a few drops of espresso over the crema to marble it.

### Step 7

- Serve the Cuban coffee hot and enjoy! It's meant to be drunk quickly while the crema foam is still thick.
